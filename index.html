                        <p>My name is Gregory Williams. I am proudly the only Son of Gregory Contee and Sharia Williams. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in Atlanta Medical Center. After spending some time in Georgia, my family and I moved to Washington, DC. where I would attend Winston Elementary school. Once I got to middle school, I was enrolled in Friendship Technology Preparatory Academy. Halfway through my middle school experience, they began building a high school for us. Here, I would go on to earn my high school diploma.</p>
